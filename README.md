A program that tests:
1. A self made Queue class, designed using linked list
2. A class which, given an input expression, checks if that expression has balanced brackets, and coverts it to postfix notation if it does.

Below is a sample of the output after running the program.


Adding to queue.

![AddToQueue](https://github.com/LordoftheBirds/CS303Assignment3/assets/70674195/db660513-741d-4f51-ba15-10e43bab9395)



Calling peek front on the queue.

Removing all items from the queue.

![removeFromQueue](https://github.com/LordoftheBirds/CS303Assignment3/assets/70674195/93a86b4f-0867-41fd-a27d-9c108d8c943f)



Proper conversion of an infix notation expression to postfix.

![postfix](https://github.com/LordoftheBirds/CS303Assignment3/assets/70674195/d8cc1a0c-6bea-458e-932a-fc1d4f572a11)



Output when the initial expression does not have properly balanced brackets.

![notBalanced](https://github.com/LordoftheBirds/CS303Assignment3/assets/70674195/e5efc389-7da2-485d-a835-d52b70b12a56)
