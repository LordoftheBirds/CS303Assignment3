A program that tests:
1. A self made Queue class, designed using linked list
2. A class which, given an input expression, checks if that expression has balanced brackets, and coverts it to postfix notation if it does.

Below is a sample of the output after running the program.

Adding to queue.
![AddToQueue](https://github.com/LordoftheBirds/CS303Assignment3/assets/70674195/ec76fcc4-cf94-48ec-84e4-485a09484168)

Calling peek front on the queue.

Removing all items from the queue.
![removeFromQueue](https://github.com/LordoftheBirds/CS303Assignment3/assets/70674195/67bbad54-e3a5-4d5d-8f97-243725500080)

Proper conversion of an infix notation expression to postfix.
![postfix](https://github.com/LordoftheBirds/CS303Assignment3/assets/70674195/54ab8787-741c-4885-8717-5eee24157aba)

Output when the initial expression does not have properly balanced brackets.
